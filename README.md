statuos
=======

Statuos is a project/task management system. 

Statuos was moved from tfs to github to make the code public and to move maintance of the server to another party (Also to learn about git(hub))

Statuos uses the following technologies.

ASP.NET MVC 4
EF Code First
AutoMapper
Castle Windsor

Statuos is still in early development and is not ready for testing/using.  I hope to have a working version around 1/1/2013.  Over time I will
improve the UI with ajax to prevent all the post backs.  Eventually I will try to add in a free css template (I am not a designer so the 
UI will likely be lacking unless a true designer would like to fix the layouts and css).
